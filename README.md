# 3D-MI-Reports

Visualization of complex Medical Imaging data such as functional connectivity, tractography, functional imaging and Multiparametric Tissue Signatures is a challenge. Recombining such data produces an even more complex problem concerning to medical interpretations.

Many different visualization solutions have been proposed. Margulies et al (2013) [1] and Rojas et al (2011; 2013) [2-3], for example, describe 2D as well as 3D neuroimaging visualization methods for tractography and functional connectivity data.

## Aplications

### 3D Medical Imaging Report
We introduce a new concept of visualization in Medical Imaging biomarkers field through web and smartphones with this prototype.
